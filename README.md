## Pre-Requisites for best experience

- [Eclipse 4.17.0+](https://www.eclipse.org/) IDE installed on your system.
- [Darkest Dark](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/darkest-dark-theme-devstyle) plugin from the Eclipse Marketplace.

## Theme Setup

The current version of the Doki Theme for Eclipse leverages the look and feel of the [Darkest Dark](https://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/darkest-dark-theme-devstyle) plugin.
The Eclipse platform's theme development experience is currently dark, scary, and very arcane.
In order to give you the best developer experience sooner, let's just take a quick shortcut!
(The future 1.0.0 release will contain the fully bundled color experience without needing DevStyles colors)

### Look and Feel Setup

You have a couple of options here friend! You can opt to use:

- The bundled look and feels from DevStyle
- The custom color theme

**Bundled looks and feels**

To save you some work, here are waifus that go best for each of the bundled themes

| Dev Style | Waifu |
| --- | --- |
| Dark Gray (Darkest Dark) | Rem, Ryuko, Rin |
| Deep Black | Darkness Dark, Ishtar Dark, Rory |
| Dark Blue | Sayori Dark, Kanna, Aqua, Rem |
| Dark Green | Just Monika |
| Dark Red | Rias |
| Dark Purple | Emilia Dark, Yuri Dark, Misato |
| Light Gray | Satsuki, Asuna |
| Light Blue | Sayori Light |
| Light Red | <No body, please don't use this ._.> |
| Light Green | Monika Light |
| Light Purple | Emilia Light, Yuri Light |

### Syntax Coloring
